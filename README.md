*NOTE*: as of 4.0, Scala 2.9.x is no longer as the client has moved to an async model using Scala 2.10.x features.
To get the old 2.9.x version see https://github.com/guardian/pa-football-2.9

A simple scala client for the PA football API

It merely interacts with the PA feeds, it does not understand Guardian Tags and match reports and so on

// matches for a specific day for all competitions
val matches = Client.matchDay(new DateMidnight(2011, 8, 27))

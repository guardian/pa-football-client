A simple scala client for the PA football API

It merely interacts with the PA feeds, it does not understand Guardian Tags and match reports and so on

Sbt dependencies

    resolvers += "Guardian Github Releases" at "http://guardian.github.com/maven/repo-releases"

    libraryDependencies += "com.gu" %% "pa-client" % "2.2"

Usage

    object Client extends PaClient with DispatchHttp {
        val apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY"
    }

    // list all competitions
    Client.competitions.foreach(println)

    // fixtures for all competitions
    val fixtures = Client.fixtures()
    fixtures.foreach(println)

    // live matches for a competition
    val matches = Client.liveMatches("100")
    matches.foreach(println)
    
    // events in a match
    val theMatch = Client.matchEvents("3507403")
    println(theMatch.homeTeam.name)

    // matches for a specific day for all competitions
    val matches = Client.matchDay(new DateMidnight(2011, 8, 27))
    matches.foreach(println)

    // matches for a specific day in a specific competition
    val matches = Client.matchDay("100", new DateMidnight(2011, 8, 27))
    matches.foreach(println)

    // results for all competitions since a certain date
    val matches = Client.results(new DateMidnight(2010, 8, 1))
    matches.foreach(println)
    
    // results for a competition since a certain date
    val matches = Client.results("100", new DateMidnight(2010, 8, 1))
    matches.foreach(println)

    // results for a competition between two dates
    val matches = Client.results("100", new DateMidnight(2012, 8, 23), new DateMidnight(2012, 9, 1))
    matches.foreach(println)
